# AngularMicroscope

## What is this?

If you look at the [MicroscopeRPG subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/MicroscopeRPG), one of the most common questions is a variation on how Microscope can be played online. There are many suggestions on how one might go about this, and they are all great. This is me tossing something else in the hat.

Microscope is a great game none the suggestions can actually guide you through the the process of setting up and running the game. This project focuses on taking the rules from the game and guiding you through the process.

This project is mainly an excuse for me to implement a project in Angular so that I'd have something to show for it. This my first Angular (not AngularJS) project, so the implementation itself might be a bit rough in some cases.

## How playable is this?

Almost! You can set the game up and go through the rounds but you cannot add any actual Period, Event, or Scene cards yet. I've arrived at a point where I want to stop and start working on the interface before I try to code up some inputs.

## This is ugly!

Yup, it sure is. My first priority was to set up the game loop so that I'd have a simpler way of going through the game screens. Now that that part is done I'll start refractoring and, yes, making the game look prettier.
